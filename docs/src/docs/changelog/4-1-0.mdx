import { NotificationsDemos } from '@mantine/demos';

## @mantine/notifications improvements

[Notifications system](https://mantine.dev/others/notifications/) functions were migrated to
[custom events](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Events/Creating_and_triggering_events),
they are no longer depend on context and can be called in any part of application.
Old way with `useNotifications` hook will work until version 5.0 release.

`@mantine/notifications` now exports the following functions:

- `showNotification` – adds given notification to notifications list or queue depending on current state and limit
- `updateNotification` – updates notification that was previously added to the state or queue
- `hideNotification` – removes notification with given id from notifications state and queue
- `cleanNotifications` – removes all notifications from notifications state and queue
- `cleanNotificationsQueue` – removes all notifications from queue

## classNames prop on MantineProvider

Same as with `styles` you can now add classes to all components with `classNames` prop on MantineProvider.
This approach is useful when you want to styles components with utility based CSS libraries.

```tsx
import { MantineProvider, Button } from '@mantine/core';

function App() {
  return (
    <MantineProvider classNames={{ Button: { root: 'button-root', label: 'button-label' } }}>
      <Button>All Button components will have the classes above</Button>
    </MantineProvider>
  );
}
```

## Mantine CSS variables

You can now set `withCSSVariables` prop on [MantineProvider](https://mantine.dev/theming/mantine-provider/) to add
[Mantine CSS variables](https://mantine.dev/theming/mantine-provider/#mantine-css-variables) from theme to `:root`.
This option is useful when you want to use Mantine theme values with CSS/SCSS or css-in-js libraries that do not have Mantine theme context.

```tsx
import { MantineProvider } from '@mantine/core';

function App() {
  return (
    <MantineProvider withCSSVariables>
      <YourApp />
    </MantineProvider>
  );
}
```

Then you will be able to use variables anywhere in your CSS:

```css
.my-button {
  background-color: var(--mantine-color-blue-6);
  font-family: var(--mantine-font-family);
  line-height: var(--mantine-line-height);
}
```

## Other changes

- [@mantine/spotlight](https://mantine.dev/others/spotlight/) now exports event based functions to open/close spotlight and perform other actions from anywhere in your application (not only in components)
- [Button](https://mantine.dev/core/button/), [Badge](https://mantine.dev/core/badge/), [ThemeIcon](https://mantine.dev/core/theme-icon/) and [Text](https://mantine.dev/core/text/) components now support hex color values in `gradient` prop
