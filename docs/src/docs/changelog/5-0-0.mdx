## Breaking changes

[Tabs](https://mantine.dev/core/tabs/) and associated [Prism.Tabs](https://mantine.dev/others/prism/) components now have new API:

- Tabs are now more accessible
- Tabs content no longer unmounts on tab change, it is hidden with `display: none`
- It is now easier to manage controlled tabs state with string value instead of index
- With new component structure it is now easier to modify styles of each part with `sx` or `classname` props
- Tabs component now support more props to customize behavior and appearance
