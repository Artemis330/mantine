## @mantine/dates improvements

[Calendar](https://mantine.dev/dates/calendar/) component was rebuilt to improved date picking experience.
Now user can change level by clicking label between next and previous controls:

<Demo data={CalendarDemos.usage} demoProps={{ toggle: true }} />

This change is applied to all components that use Calendar: [DatePicker](https://mantine.dev/dates/date-picker/), [DateRangePicker](https://mantine.dev/dates/date-range-picker/) and [RangeCalendar](https://mantine.dev/dates/range-calendar/).
There are several **breaking changes** associated with this improvement:

- All @mantine/dates components that use Calendar no longer support `withSelect` and `yearsRange` props
- Styles API names were changed to include new calendar header

## New components and hooks

[use-page-leave](https://mantine.dev/hooks/use-page-leave/) hook calls given function when mouse leaves page:

<Demo data={usePageLeaveDemo} />

## Other changes

- [Popover](https://mantine.dev/core/popover/) component now supports `width` prop to set popover body width without Styles API
