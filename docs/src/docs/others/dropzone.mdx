## Usage

Dropzone lets you capture one or more files from user.

- Accepts/rejects files based on provided mime types
- Limits individual file size
- Renders any content within dropzone with children function

## Loading state

Set `loading` prop to indicate loading state with [LoadingOverlay](/core/loading-overlay/) component.
When `loading` is set to true user cannot drop or select new files (Dropzone becomes disabled):

<Demo data={DropzoneDemos.loading} />

## Disabled state

If you want to implement your own loading state you can disable Dropzone without LoadingOverlay.
Same as with `loading`, when Dropzone is disabled user user cannot drop or select new files:

<Demo data={DropzoneDemos.disabled} />
