# Usage with preact

You can use Mantine with [preact](https://preactjs.com/)
the same way as with react with no extra steps.

## Setting up preact project

Use [preact-cli](https://github.com/preactjs/preact-cli) to scaffold new project:

```sh
npx preact-cli create default mantine-preact
```

Create `preact.config.js` to setup aliases for react:

```js
export default {
  webpack(config, env) {
    config.resolve = {
      ...config.resolve,
      alias: {
        ...config.resolve.alias,
        react: 'preact/compat',
        'react-dom/test-utils': 'preact/test-utils',
        'react-dom': 'preact/compat',
      },
    };

    return config;
  },
};
```

Install mantine dependencies:

```sh
npm install @mantine/core @mantine/hooks react-jss
```

And start application:

```sh
npm run dev
```

Now you can use all components from @mantine/core and hooks from @mantine/hooks.

## TypeScript with preact

Unfortunately, we were not able to setup Mantine with TypeScript + preact because of [this issue](https://github.com/preactjs/preact/issues/2748).
If you know how to solve it, please create a <GatsbyLink to="/pages/contributing/">pull request</GatsbyLink> with addition to this guide.
