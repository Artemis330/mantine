use-reduced-motion detects if user [prefers to reduce motion](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/@media/prefers-reduced-motion).
It uses <GatsbyLink to="/hooks/use-media-query">use-media-query</GatsbyLink> hook under the hood.
Hook relies on `window.matchMedia()` [API](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Window/matchMedia) and will always return false if api is not available (e.g. during server side rendering).

```tsx
import { useReducedMotion } from '@mantine/hooks';
```

## Definition

use-reduced-motion hook returns true if `(prefers-reduced-motion: reduce)` media query is satisfied:

```tsx
useReducedMotion(): boolean
```

## Usage

Use use-reduced-motion hook to detect if user prefers to reduce motion and set animations duration based on this value.
All Mantine components which use animations support it by default:

<UseReducedMotionDemo />
