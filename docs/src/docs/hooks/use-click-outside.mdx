# use-click-outside

use-click-outside allows detection of clicks outside of specified element.
It is usually used with modals and dropdowns to close overlay when user clicks outside.

Hook gets function as argument and calls this function once outside click was detected.
Hook returns ref that should be passed to element on which outside clicks should be captured.

## Usage

```tsx
import { useClickOutside } from '@mantine/hooks';

function Example() {
  const handleClickOutside = () => console.log('Clicked outside of div');
  const ref = useClickOutside(handleClickOutside);
  return <div ref={ref} />;
}
```

<UseClickOutsideDemo />
