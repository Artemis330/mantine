use-click-outside allows detection of clicks outside of specified element. It is usually used with modals
and dropdowns to close overlay when user clicks outside.

```tsx
import { useClickOutside } from '@mantine/hooks';
```

## Definition

Hook accepts 2 arguments:

- `handler` – function that will be called on outside click
- `events` – optional list of events that indicate outside click

Hook returns React ref object that should be passed to element on which outside clicks should be captured.

```tsx
useClickOutside<T extends HTMLElement = any>(
  handler: () => void,
  events?: string[] = ['mousedown', 'touchstart']
): React.MutableRefObject<T>
```

## Usage

Hook calls `handleClickOutside` function once outside click was detected and returns a ref that is set to div element.

```tsx
import { useClickOutside } from '@mantine/hooks';

function Example() {
  const handleClickOutside = () => console.log('Clicked outside of div');
  const ref = useClickOutside(handleClickOutside);
  return <div ref={ref} />;
}
```

### Usage example

<UseClickOutsideDemo />

## Change events

By default use-click-outside listens to `mousedown` and `touchstart` events,
you can change these events by passing an array of events as second argument:

```tsx
const ref = useClickOutside(onClickOutside, ['mouseup', 'touchend']);
```

### Custom events example

<UseClickOutsideDemo events={['mouseup', 'touchend']} />

## TypeScript

By default use-click-outside returns ref object with `React.MutableRefObject<any>` type
as ref type does not matter in almost all cases. You can specify ref type by passing a type:

```tsx
const ref = useClickOutside<HTMLDivElement>(onClickOutside);
```
