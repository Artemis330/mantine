# Architecture

This tutorial will help you learn how Mantine is built, published and deployed.

## Mantine packages

Mantine packages are located in [src folder](https://github.com/mantinedev/mantine/tree/master/src).
Packages are divided in two groups: public and private. Public packages (e.g, `@mantine/hooks`, `@mantine/core`) are published to npm,
private packages (e.g., `@mantine/demos`, `@mantine/tests`) are used as utilities for public packages or docs.

All packages are resolved with [TypeScript paths](https://www.typescriptlang.org/docs/handbook/module-resolution.html)
in [tsconfig](https://github.com/mantinedev/mantine/blob/master/tsconfig.json)
and can be imported with regular syntax `import { Button } from '@mantine/core';`
from anywhere in project, including tests, docs and other packages.
