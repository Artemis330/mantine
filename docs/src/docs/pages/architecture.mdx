# Architecture

This tutorial will help you learn how Mantine is built, published and deployed.

## Dependencies

Mantine is a monorepo, it contains all packages and docs in single repository.
Dependencies are managed with [yarn v1 workspaces](https://classic.yarnpkg.com/en/docs/workspaces/).

To manage dependencies more easily all of them are first added to [main package.json](https://github.com/mantinedev/mantine/blob/master/package.json)
and only then added to individual packages based on needs.
For the same reason packages do not have any dev dependencies, all these dependencies are listed in [main package.json](https://github.com/mantinedev/mantine/blob/master/package.json).

To assure that all dependencies are in sync [syncpack](https://www.npmjs.com/package/syncpack)
is used as part of testing script.

## Tooling

Mantine monorepo has shared [tooling configuration](https://github.com/mantinedev/mantine/tree/master/configuration) for all packages. It includes

- Webpack config generator
- Jest configuration
- TypeScript configuration
- ESLint and prettier configurations
- Storybook
- Syncpack
- .gitignore

Since all tooling is managed on larger scale, individual package always
includes only readme, package.json, \_tsconfig.json and src folder.
This approach keeps project simple and prevents duplication of dependencies and large chunks of configuration code.

## Mantine packages

Mantine packages are located in [src folder](https://github.com/mantinedev/mantine/tree/master/src).
Packages are divided in two groups: public and private. Public packages (e.g, `@mantine/hooks`, `@mantine/core`) are published to npm,
private packages (e.g., `@mantine/demos`, `@mantine/tests`) are used as utilities for public packages or docs.

All packages are resolved with [TypeScript paths](https://www.typescriptlang.org/docs/handbook/module-resolution.html)
in [tsconfig](https://github.com/mantinedev/mantine/blob/master/tsconfig.json)
and can be imported with regular syntax `import { Button } from '@mantine/core';`
from anywhere in project, including tests, docs and other packages.
