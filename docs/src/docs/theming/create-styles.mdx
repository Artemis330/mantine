# createStyles

All Mantine components are built with [emotion](https://emotion.sh/) based css-in-js library.
We recommend using `createStyles` to create styles for the rest of your application
as it provides the most convenient way to utilize Mantine theme, but it is not required
â€“ you can use any other styling tools and languages.

## Features

- As fast and lightweight as emotion: `createStyles` extends [@emotion/react](https://emotion.sh/docs/@emotion/react)
- Subscribes to your Mantine theming context
- Supports all emotion features: automatic critical css extraction during server side rendering, lazy evaluation, dynamic theming, etc.
- Server side rendering support: Next.js, Gatsby or any other environment
- Fully featured TypeScript support

## Basic usage

<Demo data={CreateStylesDemos.createStylesBasics} />

## Styles parameters

You can receive any amount of parameters as second argument of `createStyles` function,
latter you will need to pass those parameters as argument to `useStyles` hook:

<Demo data={CreateStylesDemos.createStylesParameters} />

## Composition and nested selectors

Since `createStyles` produces scoped class names you will need to create a reference to selector
in order to get static selector. `createStyles` receives `getRef` function to handle static selector creation:

<Demo data={CreateStylesDemos.createStylesComposition} />

## Media queries

<Demo data={CreateStylesDemos.createStylesMedia} />

## Using createStyles without @mantine/core

You can use `createStyles` and `MantineProvider` without any other Mantine packages:

```bash
yarn add @mantine/styles

npm install @mantine/styles
```

After installation you can import `createStyles` and other function from `@mantine/styles` instead of `@mantine/core` and use it separately:

```tsx
import { createStyles, MantineProvider, useMantineTheme } from '@mantine/styles';
```

## Can I use other css-in-js libraries with Mantine?

Yes, you can. But please note that Mantine already uses [emotion](https://emotion.sh/) and you may
have styles collisions and would have to overwrite styles with `!important`. Please consider
choosing `createStyle` before picking other libraries.
