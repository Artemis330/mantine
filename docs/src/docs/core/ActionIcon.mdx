# ActionIcon

ActionIcon communicates action that user can take.
Usually action is secondary as component does not have high emphasis.

<PageHeader
  source="mantine-core/src/ActionIcon/ActionIcon.tsx"
  docs="core/ActionIcon.mdx"
  package="@mantine/core"
/>

```tsx
import { ActionIcon } from '@mantine/core';
```

<ActionIconRootDemo />

## General usage

You can use any React node as icon by passing it as a child to ActionIcon component.
Note that component **does not control icon size** and you need to specify it manually on icon component for better fit.

You can use icons from any react icons library, for example:

- [radix icons](https://icons.modulz.app/) (used in mantine packages)
- [feather](https://feathericons.com/)
- [react-icons](https://react-icons.github.io/react-icons)

## Where to use

Use action icon to indicate secondary action, for example to close modal or toggle password visibility. Keep in mind that component has low emphasis.

Password input visibility toggle example:

## Variants

ActionIcon has 3 variants:

- `transparent` – icon without background, hover and active styles
- `hover` (default) – icon without background, with hover and active styles
- `filled` – icon with background, hove and active styles

<ActionIconVariantDemo />

By combining `variant` and `color` props you can create switch/checkbox with ActionIcon.
Make sure to check if <GatsbyLink to="/core/switch">Switch</GatsbyLink> or <GatsbyLink to="/core/checkbox">Checkbox</GatsbyLink> components
fit your needs first as ActionIcon will be less accessible in this case.

## Change color, size and radius

ActionIcon has predefined sizes: xs, sm, md, lg, xl.
You can pass size as number and it will be set as width and height in px.

```tsx
<ActionIcon size="sm" /> // -> predefined small size
<ActionIcon size={50} /> // -> { width: 50, height: 50 }
```

### Default size values

You can get default sizes for action icon by importing `ACTION_ICON_SIZES`:

```tsx
import { ACTION_ICON_SIZES } from '@mantine/core';
```

<DataTable
  head={['Prop value', 'Width and height']}
  data={Object.keys(ACTION_ICON_SIZES).map((size) => [size, `${ACTION_ICON_SIZES[size]}px`])}
/>

Same with radius – predefined values for xs, sm, md, lg, xl are defined in <GatsbyLink to="/theming">theme</GatsbyLink>,
or pass in number to set border-radius in px:

```tsx
<ActionIcon radius="lg" /> // -> theme predefined large radius
<ActionIcon radius={10} /> // -> { borderRadius: 10 }
```

Size and color are only visible when user interacts with hover, active and focus.

You can choose any color defined in <GatsbyLink to="/theming">theme</GatsbyLink> for ActionIcon.

```tsx
<ActionIcon color="red" />
<ActionIcon color="blue" />
```

## Compose with ElementsGroup

You can compose ActionIcon with any other components that support composition feature with <GatsbyLink to="/core/elements-group">ElementGroup</GatsbyLink> component.

<ActionIconGroupDemo />

## Get element ref

You can get button ref by passing `ref` prop to ActionIcon component:

```tsx
import React, { useRef } from 'react';
import { ActionIcon } from '@mantine/core';

function ActionIconDemo() {
  // ref.current instanceof HTMLButtonElement
  const ref = useRef<HTMLButtonElement>(null);
  return <ActionIcon ref={ref} />;
}
```

## Component props

<PropsTable component="ActionIcon" />

## Accessibility

ActionIcon renders a regular button element.
As by design element does not have text content
make sure to include `title` and `aria-label` props for better accessibility.
