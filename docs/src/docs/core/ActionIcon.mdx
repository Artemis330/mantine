# ActionIcon

ActionIcon communicates action that user can take.
Usually action is secondary as component does not have high emphasis.

<PageHeader
  source="mantine-core/src/ActionIcon/ActionIcon.tsx"
  docs="core/ActionIcon.mdx"
  package="@mantine/core"
/>

```tsx
import { ActionIcon } from '@mantine/core';
```

## General usage

You can use any React node as icon by passing it as a child to ActionIcon component.
Note that component **does not control icon size** and you need to specify it to fit in.

You can use icons from any react icons library, for example:

- [radix icons](https://icons.modulz.app/) (used in mantine packages)
- [feather](https://feathericons.com/)
- [react-icons](https://react-icons.github.io/react-icons)

## Change color, size and radius

ActionIcon has predefined sizes: xs, sm, md, lg, xl.
You can pass size as number and it will be set as width and height in px.

```tsx
<ActionIcon size="sm" /> // -> predefined small size
<ActionIcon size={50} /> // -> { width: 50, height: 50 }
```

Same with radius â€“ predefined values for xs, sm, md, lg, xl are defined in <GatsbyLink to="/theming">theme</GatsbyLink>,
or pass in number to set border-radius in px:

```tsx
<ActionIcon radius="lg" /> // -> theme predefined large radius
<ActionIcon radius={10} /> // -> { borderRadius: 10 }
```

Size and color are only visible when user interacts with hover, active and focus.

You can choose any color defined in <GatsbyLink to="/theming">theme</GatsbyLink> for ActionIcon.

```tsx
<ActionIcon color="red" />
<ActionIcon color="blue" />
```

## Accessibility

ActionIcon renders a regular button element.
As by design element does not have text content
make sure to include `title` and `aria-label` props for better accessibility.
