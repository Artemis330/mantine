## Usage

ScrollArea component is based on [Radix UI scroll area component](https://www.radix-ui.com/docs/primitives/components/scroll-area).
It is adapted to work well with light and dark color schemes and supports following props:

- `type` defines scrollbars behavior:
  - `hover` – scrollbars are visible on hover
  - `scroll` – scrollbars are visible on scroll
  - `auto` – similar to `overflow: auto` – scrollbars are always visible whether the content is overflowing
  - `always` – same as `auto` but scrollbars are always visible regardless of whether the content is overflowing
