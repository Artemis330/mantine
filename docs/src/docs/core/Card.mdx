## Usage

Card component is a wrapper around [Paper](/core/paper/) component
with context styles for CardSection component.
Combine Card component with other Mantine components to create cards with your design requirements:

<Demo data={CardDemos.usage} />

## CardSection

CardSection is a special component that is used to remove Card padding from its children while other elements still have horizontal spacing.
CardSection works the following way:

- It component is a first child in Card then it has negative top, left and right margins
- If it is a last child in Card then it has negative bottom, left and right margins
- If it is in the middle then only left and right margins will be negative

```tsx
<Card padding="xl">
  {/* top, right, left margins are negative – -1 * theme.spacing.xl */}
  <CardSection>First section</CardSection>

  {/* Content that is not inside CardSection will have theme.spacing.xl spacing on all sides relative to Card */}
  <Text>Some other content</Text>

  {/* right, left margins are negative – -1 * theme.spacing.xl */}
  <CardSection>Middle section</CardSection>

  {/* bottom, right, left margins are negative – -1 * theme.spacing.xl */}
  <CardSection>Last section</CardSection>
</Card>
```

Note that Card relies on mapping direct children and you cannot use fragments or others wrappers for CardSection:

```tsx
<Card padding="xl">
  <div>
    <CardSection>Won't work</CardSection>
  </div>

  <>
    <CardSection>Won't work either</CardSection>
  </>

  <CardSection>Works fine</CardSection>
</Card>
```

## Link overlay

Use [Overlay](/core/overlay/) component with 0 opacity
to create link overlay. Note that, card context styles (negative margins and border-radius) rely on `:fist-child` and `:last-child`,
if you need preserve them, do not put overlay as first or last element.

<Demo data={CardDemos.overlay} />

## Get element ref

You can get root element ref by setting `elementRef` prop:

```tsx
import { useRef } from 'react';
import { Card } from '@mantine/core';

function Demo() {
  const ref = useRef();
  return <Card elementRef={ref} />;
}
```
