## Usage

Dialog is a simplified version of [Modal](/core/modal/) component.
It does not include most of accessibility and usability [Modal](/core/modal/) features:

- Focus trap is not available
- Does not close on click outside
- Does now have overlay

Use Dialog to attract attention with not important information or action,
for example, you can create an email subscription form:

<Demo data={DialogDemos.usage} />

## Paper props

Component supports all props from [Paper](/core/paper/) component,
you can customize `shadow`, `padding` and `radius` same way.

```tsx
<Dialog shadow="xl" padding={30} radius="sm" />
```

## Change transition

Dialog supports all transition from [Transition](/core/transition/) component.
To change transition provide following props:

- **transition** – predefined transition name or transition object
- **transitionDuration** – transition duration in ms, defaults to 200ms
- **transitionTimingFunction** – timing function, defaults to `theme.transitionTimingFunction`

```tsx
<Dialog transition="slide-up" transitionDuration={300} transitionTimingFunction="ease" />
```

## Accessibility

Component is not accessible and most likely will not be announced by screen reader,
make sure you do not put any important information. In most cases it would be much better
to select [Modal](/core/modal/), [Drawer](/core/drawer/) or [Notifications](/others/notifications/).
