import { FormDemos } from '@mantine/demos';

## Validation with rules object

To validate form with rules object, provide an object of functions which take field value as an argument
and return error message (any React node) or null if field is valid:

<Demo data={FormDemos.rulesValidation} />

## Validation based on other form values

You can get all form values as a second rule function argument to perform field validation based on other
form values. For example, you can validate that password confirmation is the same as password:

<Demo data={FormDemos.password} />
